# WALAS: Weight Acquisition and Logging Automated System

The Weight Acquisition and Logging Automated System (WALAS) is a project designed specifically for The FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology to enhance their bird research efforts. This system offers an efficient and automated solution for acquiring and logging bird weights, streamlining the data collection process and facilitating more accurate and comprehensive research.

## Features

- **Automated Weight Acquisition**: The system is equipped with a load cell which connects to an esp micro-controller to automatically acquire bird weights without manual intervention, reducing human error and saving time.
  
- **Data Logging**: WALAS includes a logging feature that records acquired weights along with relevant metadata such as timestamp and bird image. This data is stored in a structured format for easy retrieval over a web page accessed through IP addressing.



## Usage

Researchers can follow these steps to use the WALAS system effectively:

1. **Setup**: Install WALAS in desired locations and connect them according to the provided instructions.

2. **Configuration**: Ensure WALAS is powered on.

3. **Data Acquisition**: Let the system autonomously acquire bird weights in the birds' natural habitat

4. **Data Analysis**: Retrieve logged data from the system and analyze it using relevant tools or software. Derive insights and conclusions from the analyzed data.

5. **Maintenance**: Regularly maintain and calibrate the WALAS system to ensure optimal performance and data accuracy.
